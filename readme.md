# The sky is not the limit 
The old saying goes "the sky is the limit", but actually, there is no limit. 
The only limit is your mind. 

The question you should ask yourself is: "What do you want to achieve in your limited time on earth."
If you know what your goal is, go for it: use your resources and give it your best shot.
When you're not sure: dare to dream. And dream BIG!

Work hard for your dreams, be disciplined and persevering, leave the past behind, get up, walk, 
run and fly for your dreams. Every day you have a new opportunity! Don't be afraid of time, 
because it's never too late!
