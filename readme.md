#The sky is not the limit 
The old saying goes "the sky is the limit", but actually, there is no limit. 
The only limit is your mind. 
The question you should ask yourself is: 
"What do you want to achieve in your limited time on earth."
If you know what your goal is XXX

When I was 15 years old, one of my cousins invited my sister, her sister and me to the circus where  [Margarito](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarito_Machacuay_Valera), the tallest man in Peru, who had come for the festivities in our city, was going to perform. He was 2.27 m tall and an actor. The circus performance was incredible but the afternoon was still long so we went to the roller coaster fair. I had never been on one before and that was my first time. I had to sit on the first trolley with my cousin. At first I wasn't very scared but everything changed when you were up there, it seemed that everything was endless and that we weren't going to come back alive hehe. My cousin was nervous but calm all the time and I shouted everything. I remember that it came out from the depths of my being "Mommy, Mommy, I swear I'll never get on this thing" and a boy shouted in response "see you in heaven" and my cousin answered him at the top of her lungs "shut up, you idiot". Finally everything ended well and with many laughs.
From that day on I only ride smaller roller coasters. Now I do it with my daughter, who loves it but who on our last ride shouted "I don't want to anymore, I don't want to anymore mum" "My heart is coming out". I like to remember the phrases forever!
